        <p>
          One of the most recognizable structures in the world, the Roman
          Colosseum is the largest building remaining from Roman times. Its
          imposing presence in the city center of modern day Rome is a testament
          to the incredible history of the city and the achievements of the
          Roman Empire.
          </p>
          <p>
          Visitors popping up from the nearest subway stop or turning a corner
          and seeing it for the first time can't help but be stunned by its
          immense presence. Construction began on the structure in AD 72 and
          today, it is still one of the greatest tourist attractions in the
          world.

          The Italian Government has recently announced that the floor of the
          Colosseum, once the battlegrounds of brave gladiators, will be
          restored to its former glory. This will allow the Colosseum to be used
          for cultural and other special events and for visitors to imagine what
          it would have been like to stand and look up at the roaring crowds.

        One of the most iconic sites in the world, the Pyramids of Giza, just outside Cairo, are a surreal sight rising from the barren desert landscape. Standing guard nearby, and almost as impressive, is the Sphinx, gazing blankly out over the land.
        </p>
<p>
The pyramids were built as tombs for the Pharaohs, the largest of which was constructed between 2560 and 2540 BC. To put their age in perspective, they were already more than 2,600 years old when the Colosseum in Rome was being built. Today, these giant monuments are the sole surviving member of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
<br/>
</p>
<p>
For a memorable experience, take a sunset camel ride in front of the pyramids, one of the top things to do in Egypt. Also, be sure to follow the inner tunnels in the Pyramid of Chephren or the Pyramid of Cheops to the burial chamber deep inside.

        <p>
            Stretching almost 6,000 kilometers as it snakes its way through forests and mountains, the Great Wall of China is one of those undeniable bucket list sites that have long inspired great adventures. This massive wall, connecting battlements and watchtowers, was built over the centuries, with the oldest sections dating back to the 7th century BC.</p>
<p>
Today, you can opt to simply visit the wall on a day trip from Beijing, or tackle whole sections of it on organized, multi-day trips. Some sections of the wall have been restored, while other sections are badly in need of repair.
